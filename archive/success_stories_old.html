                    <p>Complications during orthopaedic surgery several years ago resulted in over twenty five further surgeries and procedures, ongoing rehabilitation (which saved my lower leg from amputation) and my medical retirement from my job as a Senior Associate Clinical Psychologist within the NHS. Clearly this was life-changing, however always one to seek the positive and get on with things I began training with several Paralympic squads with a view to competing in the 2012 Paralympic games. Further surgery prevented this so I returned to my first love of horses and ponies and joined the Riding For The Disabled (RDA)! As well as being crucial to my rehabilitation I now have my sights firmly set upon attaining a place on the dressage team for the 2016 Paralympic games in Rio!</p><br />
                    
					<p>I recently represented Lancashire at the NW Regional competition and the North West at the RDA National Championships, borrowing horses at short notice for each event. Both were wonderful experiences and great fun. I have since joined the RDA volunteer database; have been elected to join the RDA Expert Panel; was invited to ride a para-dressage demonstration at Blenheim Palace Horse Trials and also at the NW Regional Conference, and have been invited to represent the RDA at the World Horse
Welfare Annual Conference in London. All are fabulous opportunities and I am very honoured and privileged to have been invited to take part.</p><br />
					<p> I am also training to be both a BHS and RDA Instructor in the hope that I can utilise my experiences and skills to help others to enjoy the benefits that RDA has afforded me. The RDA magnificently enables people to enjoy equestrianism without huge expense, and thereby benefit from the pleasures and therapeutic gains associated with equine contact.</p><br />
 					<p>Sadly I couldn’t ride at Blenheim due to the lack of a suitable horse but now, thanks to The Anders Foundation, I have a wonderful horse called Fleur De Vassy. Competing at the higher levels unfortunately requires sponsorship and a particular type of horse; as such I am so lucky to have Fleur so that I can achieve my dreams and one day ride for GB in the Paralympics. I am also proud that other disabled riders will be able to ride Fleur and enjoy some memorable days out in a non-competitive environment!</p><br />

                    <p>Jamie Jessup from the Wimbledon Racquets & Fitness Club who was fortunate enough to have a Kidney Transplant 14 years ago - has just returned from Durban, South Africa where he represented GB in the World Transplant Games in July, 2013. Jamie brought home for Team GB the Badminton Singles Silver Medal in the 18-29 age category.</p><br />
                    <p>Jamie says, "It was such a fantastic experience to go to Durban to represent my country in Badminton; I am passionate about the game and wanted to do well. I was in serious training for over a year, ever since being selected back in 2012 after my performance at the British Transplant Games where I won Gold in the mens’ doubles.</p><br />
                    <p>In the lead up to the Worlds I was upping my game and having coaching from Sam Phillips & Dave Hutchinson. It certainly paid off when the day arrived for the competition in South Africa! In the singles I had a very tough draw and was up against players from France, GB, Iran, and in the final it was Iran again. In the semi's my energy had all been taken playing against the Iran player, but once I had beaten him I was thrilled knowing I had a chance of winning gold.
The finals took place only 30 mins after my semi's: I managed to win the first game, (I think it was purely on Adrenaline) but I lost the 2nd & 3rd.</p><br />
                    <p>I can honestly say I am thrilled with a "World Silver Medal" & being ranked World Number 2 within the World Transplant Games Federation; this is something that will live with me forever! 
The second day of the Badminton I played mens’ doubles & mixed but, unfortunately, I couldn’t perform well as my legs were totally knackered, despite having an hour with our GB physio. It wasn't to be and we lost our doubles to the Thailand pair who were the eventual Gold Medallists.</p><br />
                    <p>The same happened in the mixed which was in the afternoon. By this time my legs had totally seized up and we were knocked out by a Bulgarian pair.</p><br />
                    <p>I am happy with my performance & can honestly say that being given that second chance in life has taught me something, and that is to enjoy every day as if it is my last & I certainly do do that. Especially in South Africa.</p><br />
                    <p>I would like to say thank you so much to everyone at the Anders Foundation who has taken their time to help me along this wonderful journey and made a dream become reality, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart! </p><br />
                    <p>But can I just ask one thing of you, please could you take a second or two, to sign up to the ORGAN DONATION REGISTER! As you too could help save someone's life, just like some one helped me!"</p><br />

                    <p>Deborah Criddle MBE is a British para-equestrian who won three Gold Medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens and one Gold Medal and two Silver Medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.</p><br />
                    <p>She lost the use of her right arm and right leg following a motorcycle accident in 1985, eventually having the arm amputated in 2003. As a result she competes in the Grade III Paralympic Classification.</p><br />
                    <p>Deb first competed at the Paralympics at the 2000 Games held in Sydney, Australia, where she finished eighth in the Individual Grade III event and fourth in the Freestyle Grade III.  She won Individual, Freestyle and Team Gold Medals at both the 2001 European Championships and the 2003 World Championships.  At the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece, she won three Gold Medals.  Riding the Nina Venables owned horse Figaro IX she won the Individual and Freestyle Grade III events and was a part of Great Britain's victorious squad in the Team Championship.  This made her and Figaro the first horse and rider combination to have won triple gold at consecutive European, World and Paralympic Games.  At the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China, she was selected to compete as an individual rider and she finished fifth in the Individual and fourth in the Freestyle.</p><br />
                    <p>She was selected as part of the dressage squad for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, United Kingdom.  Riding LJT Akilles she won a silver medal in the Grade III Individual event with a score of 71.267%, finishing behind Germany's gold medalist Hannalore Brenner who scored 73.467%, despite having to ask the judges for directions.  Criddle's result helped to secure a Gold Medal for the British squad, which also included Sophie Christiansen, Lee Pearson and Sophie Wells, in the Team Championship.  She won her third medal of the 2012 Paralympics, a Silver, in the Freestyle Grade III.  </p><br />
                    <p>Criddle was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to equestrianism.</p>

                    <p>After a hugely successful 2012, with the culmination of Team Gold and 2 Individual Silvers at the Paralympic Games, this year has been a real mixed bag.  A bad start to the international competition season put LJT Akilles and I on our back feet.</p><br />

                	<p>Even winning the National Championship in my disability grade wasn’t enough to secure us a place on the European Championship squad this summer.  We did however manage to qualify for a Disabled Rider class at the British Dressage National Championships along with a surprise qualification in an ‘able bodied’ open class.  Equestrian is one of the few sports that is fully integrated, not only mixed gender but also disabled riders competing in the same classes as able bodied riders.</p><br />             
                    <p>The qualification classes for our Winter Championships are well underway with our first test giving us maximum points.  </p><br />
                    <p>I am hugely grateful to The Anders Foundation for awarding me a training grant which I intend to use to further improve my riding technique, which in turn will improve my communication with my horse. I will keep you posted...</p><br />

                    <p>Back on track!  LJT Akilles and I had a great result at the National Championships with a win in the KBIS Disabled Rider Championship and our best performance yet in a Para class.  All the hard work at home paid dividends with a smooth and harmonious test on the day.</p><br />  
                    
					<p>We perform set floor plans for each disability grade and in very basic terms, for those with no knowledge of dressage, they are designed to test our ability to control the horse in various paces and our accuracy in carrying out particular movements.  The tests take 5 minutes on average to perform and the horse needs warming up for anything between 30-60 minutes beforehand. Completing the second of our tests in the able-bodied Advanced Medium class was a highlight for me.  We had absolutely no chance of coming anywhere other than near the bottom of the class just because of the quality of horses and the professional nature of many of the riders, but I had such fun.  My goal had been not to be last and we managed to come 27th out of 32.  It has definitely wetted my appetite for another chance so we shall have to get out now to try to qualify for the Winter Championships.</p><br />

                    <p>My New Year resolution is to be fitter this year and develop more core strength.  I have made a start with short sessions on the cross-trainer which I will gradually build up in length as my unstable right knee becomes accustomed to the added stress and strain.  Having said that, it seems to be the good one that is protesting more at the moment!  I shall also book a place on a Pilates course or even arrange some private sessions so that I can specifically cover exercises best suited to riders.  At Christmas I treated myself to a book called ‘Pilates for Riders’ and it has provided me with a real source of motivation.  I have also now found three possible venues and trainers for my intensive lunge sessions but as they all teach outside I will wait for some better weather before booking.</p><br />  
                    
					<p>A few days before Christmas Akilles and I were out competing in Cornwall and whilst he was a bit fresh and feisty we had a good result with a win in the Advanced Medium Freestyle.  This qualified us for a second class at the British Dressage SW Regional Winter Championship to be held in February, a good end to 2013.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>I sat down and made my 2014 Competition Plan; short, medium and long term goals are vital to a successful training regime and while the plan may need tweaking over the year it makes a good solid starting point.  It means I can see where I need to have Akilles at peak fitness and where I can afford to ‘let him down’ a little as it is tough on a horse to push them hard throughout the season, dressage taxes the horse both physically and mentally.  The overall long term goal is obviously Rio in 2016, the European Championships 2015 are the medium term goal with the short term one being the World Equestrian Games in France this summer.  My goals for this year are to acquit myself well in open able-bodied classes, to be top Grade III Para rider in national competitions and make it on to the World Championship team.  Hopefully I’m not being too greedy!</p><br />

                    <p>The Charity was formed over fifty years ago to use ponies as therapy to improve the co-ordination and health of handicapped children and adults. They maintain their own ponies and have their own purpose built indoor riding school in the village of Willington, Beds. Most of their riders come from specialist schools in Bedfordshire but also take adults from the Sue Ryder home and other people are referred to us by their GP's. Last year we had over 100 riders.</p>

                 <div id="two_column_content">
                	<span class="two_column_content_heading">Fundraising</span>
                    <p>Every year we need to raise approximately £20,000 just to keep things ticking over and we do this by organising fetes, craft fayres, coffee mornings and musical evenings but in these times of austerity it gets harder and harder to raise this amount.  We also apply for funding from charitable institutions and family trusts.</p>

                 <div id="two_column_content">
                	<span class="two_column_content_heading">Expenses</span>
                    <p>Our expenses are continually rising. For example in 2011 our horse expenses were £7734 but rose 15% in 2012 and will be higher again this year. We also need additional capital investment to maintain and improve our facilities. We do not have any administrative costs as all our helpers are volunteers apart from the lady who  feeds and cares for the ponies.</p>

                    <p>The players introduced themselves to the pupils and shared a tiny piece of their success story thus far.  Afterwards Lorraine ran a competition for the pupils where Xander and Rajeev helped score and provided some extra encouragement and coaching.  The players kindly donated T'shirts that were presented to the winners along with certificates for everyone from the Club.  Xander also brought along photos and Rajeev passed around his, much treasured, Singles World Gold medal.  Rajeev is deaf himself and has played in the All England a number of times, when he represented India as a professional player and now competes very successfully for England in World Masters Events.  </p>

                    <p>Lorraine (left) has been working with the younger pupils at the school and latterly with the Yr 9/10 pupils at the Club. The whole experience has been a learning curve for everyone involved. Lorraine said that she is now much more aware of the communication challenges deaf people face in, what is essentially, a hearing world. </p><br />
					<p>We very much look forward to continuing working with the school after the summer.</p>
