				<div class="blog-content">
					<p>The Anders Nielsen Golf Day was held again at The RAC Club Epsom on Monday June 20th and for the first time since its inception the weather wasn’t at all kind but this didn’t affect the impressive turnout or the fun! The scoring was lower than ever
						as heavy rain flooded many greens early on but the rain abated around halfway and a winning score of 82 was recorded by Gorm Nielsen and his international team!</p><br />

					<p>Thanks must go to the RAC Club for keeping the course open amidst the heavy rain and for the players persevering with many of us thinking that Anders was somewhere laughing at us considering he would never have even stepped outside in rain like that
						let alone play golf! This was also our first Golf Day without partnering Sparks so the organisation was passed to Rehanna Nielsen who did a magnificent job and made sure that a healthy total was raised for the Foundation and it’s great causes. Thanks
						to all!</p><br />

					<p>Morning started early at around 5.30am. This was it! The day had finally come. All those winter months spent pounding round Richmond Park, Cheam/ Epsom and further afield, with my running buddies and I am now an expert on the science behind nutrition,
						experimenting with protein, carbohydrates, gels, electrolyte drinks, etc., what to have and in what quantity as well as the no, nos, all to get the best possible performance out of me on the day. I was about to put it all to the test!</p> <br />

					<p>Nervously gathering at Greenwich for the start and seeing all the charity runners get ready, suddenly I realised, this is the reason why I am doing this. We are all here to run for our own special cause and raise as much funds as possible. From this
						point on I was able to relax and was now ready to soak up the amazing atmosphere that everyone talks about. The crowds were out in their thousands, cheering us all on. The bands were playing. It was electrifying! I ran alongside a Rhino, Upsy Daisy,
						a man with a washing machine on his back, two paddling Indians in a Kayak, four firemen in a boat and latterly Jesus carrying a cross running barefoot! All amazing people running for a charity that is personal to them.</p> <br />
					<p>Thank you to Anders Foundation for giving me this opportunity to be able to take part in such a wonderful event and also a huge thank you to all my sponsors for their support, whom have given so generously. I will never forget this experience.

					<p>Clive Noel, a close friend of Anders, has entered the revered 'Tour du Mont Blanc'."</p><br />
					<p>Clive says "This is a brutal Alpine cycling race covering 330 km and 8000 metres of climb....in one day, yes, one day! Most riders don't finish....I'll do my best not to be one of them."<br /></p>
					<p><a class="column_link" href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserProfilePage.action?userUrl=CliveNoel">http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserProfilePage.action?userUrl=CliveNoel</a><br /></p>
					<p><strong>News after the event from Clive:</strong></p>
					<p>Well, as some of you know, I had to withdraw from the Tour du Mont Blanc with mechanical failure, namely a snapped chain at the top of the Col du St Bernard, just over a 100 miles in.</p><br />
					<p>A big disappointment as I was making very good time and feeling good. I had a support driver (thankfully !) and by his reckoning I was in the top 30 at that point. There was unfortunately no mechanical support for this race because of the sheer
							distance involved, and in the event of a snapped chain, it's game over.</p><br />
					<p>There's no guarantee I would have finished anyway, as later in the day, there were quite horrendous storms, driving rain, wind and a significant drop in temperature, as happens at altitude, hence many riders were told to abandon by race marshals,
							as conditions were too dangerous to continue.</p><br />
					<p>As we started in the dark at 5am, not great opportunity for photos unfortunately, but here are a couple...</p><br />
					<p><strong>From all the Trustees of the Anders Foundation, our thanks go to Clive and for his great fund-raising effort and safe return.</strong></p>

					<p>Sam Gale and David Barker from Sparks were responsible for running the event in their normal extremely efficient manner and we are proud to share the spoils between The Anders Foundation and Sparks - two very deserving charities.</p><br />
					<p>It is perhaps quite fitting that the overall team prize was won by the ‘Litebulb Meld’ team of badminton players including Nick Ponting, Dave Wright, Nathan Robertson and Rob Nock whilst Dave also won the individual prize for best stableford score
						of 43 points which has earned him a free trip to Mexico! Nick and Dave were best friends of Anders and there by his side through thick and thin as he struggled with his cancer whilst Nick is also a trustee of The Anders Foundation. Anders’ mother
						Heather Nielsen was also on hand to present the prizes and star in the photographs!</p><br />

				<div class="blog-content">
					<p>The English Para-Badminton Team was at Hatfield Sports Village at the weekend for a training camp with a little bit of a twist.</p><br />
					<p>Fourteen of the England team travelled to attend the preparation camp before the first English International Open at Loughborough University next week. Nearly 100 players will be competing in an event featuring 23 classifications.</p><br />

					<p>The England stars are preparing to take on some of the best players in the world and the tournament starts with classification on Monday and runs until Sunday, 28 June.</p><br />

					<p>Last Saturday morning’s session was “a brilliant standard,” said coach Tom Mills – and there was a special surprise for the players in the afternoon.</p><br />

					<p>The Anders Foundation is a charity that supports Para-Badminton in any way that they can and they sponsored the team to help organise some extra sparring players for match practice session in the afternoon.</p><br />

					<p>Former world champions and Olympic silver medallists Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms, double Commonwealth gold medallist Jo Goode and All England champion and Commonwealth bronze medallist Nick Pointing all attended the training camp to give England’s
						para players a well-deserved reward.</p><br />
					<p>Head coach Richard Morris said: “It was one of the best sessions I have ever seen. The two hours of constant matches created some amazing rallies and some very tight games.”</p><br />

					<p>The players will travel to Loughborough to take on the best in the world with some great advice and matches from the weekend’s training. This will hopefully result in the squad accumulating a group of medals in all categories so good luck to all
						the players. Come on England!</p><br />
					<p>The photos include Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson with Daniel Lee from Ebad and the group shot showing all the players.</p><br />

					<p>From Lucy Cowen, <a class="column_link" href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/LucyCowen">http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/LucyCowen</a><br /></p>
						<p>On Wednesday 4th June 2014 I really did test my nerves to the limit while abseiling down the iconic Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth!<br /></p>
						<p>It wasn’t until I was driving down the A34 on my way to Portsmouth that I really gave what I was doing much thought. As I drove through torrential rain showers I was beginning to get slightly hopeful that I might be let off the hook.</p><br />

						<p>After being strapped into our harnesses, topped off by a hard hat and leather gloves, we were given step by step instructions and safety information. The guys from ‘Appetite For Adventure’ made it all sound so easy.</p><br />

						<p>Then it was time to be clipped on and stepping very gingerly over the edge. The hardest part for me was actually making the final commitment by taking my left leg off the ledge, it is hard to believe that the ropes and harness will hold you. </p><br
						/>

						<p>I can’t say my descent was particularly spectacular, more an ungainly dangle down the very smooth painted wall!</p><br />

						<p>Of course I did all this to raise money for The Anders Foundation which was formed as a legacy to Anders Nielsen who sadly lost his life in 2010 after a year-long fight with Cancer.</p><br />

					<h2>Tough Mudder Northwest 2013</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="blog-content">
					<p>On Saturday October 5th The Anders Foundation were represented at Tough Mudder Northwest, raising over &pound;1000 so far! The team consisted of Nick Ponting, Jonty Davis, Greg Herdman, Lisa Ponting, Chris Hunt and David Hunt. It took the team 3
						hours and 10 minutes to complete the 12 mile course through more mud than anyone could imagine, two obstacles that involved electric shocsks and the infamous 'Arctic Enema'! </p><br />
					<p>We look forward to doing it again next year with a bigger team!</p>
