					<p>The Anders Foundation is helping Emma have regular individual coaching as she has progressed so well within our Talent Spotting Sessions over the last few years.</p><br />
					<p>The 2017-2018 badminton season has ended on a high note for para-badminton player Emma Stoner. Having been selected for the Surrey U14A team, she enjoyed her first season of (non para) county matches. The season ended well; Surrey attended the annual
						invitational tournament in York against seven other county teams. Having progressed through the group stages, they won a hard fought semi final against Lothian and were through to the final against Yorkshire. The final was very close but Surrey
						narrowly conceded victory and took home silver medals. A week later, history repeated itself at the Shires Final held in Wolverhampton, Surrey again playing well but ultimately losing in the final to a strong Yorkshire side. The team should be proud
						of their achievements, expertly guided by their coaches Tom Saunders and Jackie Cunningham. They certainly won the prize for loudest team support! Emma also got the chance to take part in a coaching session at Ebbisham with two of her badminton
						hero's - Rajiv Ouseph and Chris Langridge - and was very interested to hear about Chris's experiences in the Surrey junior programme. She has plans to do lots more tournaments next year. Huge thanks to the Anders Foundation for all the continued
						support and encouragement, without which none of this would have been possible.</p><br />

					<p><span class="bold">World School Games 2018</span></p>
					<p><span class="bold">Pune – India</span></p><br />
					<p>Team : Leah Allen, Tash Lado, Megan Thomas, Angie Wong</p>
					<p>Coaches : Kat Hurrell & Rob Wylie</p><br />

					<p>From the 18th to the 25th of April 2018 The Westgate School badminton team were given the opportunity to represent England playing in the World School Games in Pune, India. Having won gold in the National Schools Championships previously in 2017
						this allowed them to qualify representing Team England in this prestigious event. Firstly the teams were welcomed with the opening ceremony and were lead in by horses. Tash Lado had the honour of leading England in on one of these horses. The opening
						ceremony included cultural dances and encouraging speeches and the tournament was nearing a start.</p><br />

					<p>The competition began in the impressive 16 court arena after the opening ceremony. Westgate faced the strong French national team first, followed by China, Brazil and India B. The competition was strong and they gave some very good performances as
						a team finishing 6th in the world overall. Although the atmosphere was highly competitive and fierce the event gave opportunities to meet and interact with all of the other players from around the world.</p><br />

					<p>After four tough days of competition in the 40 degree heat, the cultural programme was to follow, this included visiting castles and temples as well as the large street market in Pune. Here the team were able to witness the hardships and differences
						of life in India. One of the final nights consisted of a cultural evening where each nation held a stall relating to their country, containing national paraphernalia and delicacies. Each country also had to complete a performance on stage to the
						other Nations. This was a high spirited and enthusiastic event which the whole team thoroughly enjoyed.</p><br />

					<p>Whilst preparing for the trip, money was raised in order to provide sporting equipment to a local Indian school. While the team were there they were lucky enough to be able to personally go and present the sports equipment along with meeting and
						talking with the children and the founder of the School. This was a moment that was particularly enjoyed by the team as they were able to see the impact they could make on the school first hand.</p><br />

					<p>Thanks go to The Anders Foundation, Match Sports Agency and everyone that contributed to the Crowdfunding page. This experience was so different to any opportunity ever had before and they would collectively would like to thank everyone who made
						it possible for them to go. Overall an incredible time at The World School Games.</p><br />

					<p><span class="bold">Last year:</span></p><br />
					<p>I came 4th at the Winter Para Dressage Gold Championships with Sky, a wonderful achievement considering my trainer had been ill and I had to find a new trainer at very short notice.</p><br />

					<p>Qualified and competed both horses at the Gold Semi Finals. Got selected to represent GB with both horses at Hartpury 3* International. Sky finished three times and this was second to a triple Paralympic gold medalist. Bear finished in the top 6
						which was a great achievement for his first ever international and shows that we have an exciting future in the sport.</p><br />

					<p>Sky and I qualified to compete at the Gold Finals at the British Dressage National Championships. We won and became Grade 1 Gold National Champion. Sky and I received the selection criteria for the Para Dressage Europeans 2017. I was selected onto
						the BEF Excel Talent Programme.</p><br />
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="two_column_right">

				<p>The results I have achieved this year have been incredible and really show that hard work pays off. With the continued deterioration in my condition it has not been easy but I have stuck with it and will continue to keep fighting. A lot of people
					have asked me how do you do it and that I am very inspiring but I have one motto and that is ‘everything happens for a reason’; I can do it as I have a goal and that’s to win a gold medal and until I do that I will not stop!</p><br />

				<p>I am already so excited about 2018 and am really hoping we can step up another level, aiming for selection for a major championship this would be the absolute icing on the cake and would bring me a massive step closer to winning my first medal!</p><br

				<p><span class="bold">This year:</span></p><br />
				<p>The season hasn’t got off to the best start but under exceptional circumstances I qualified and competed both horses at the Winter Para Dressage Gold Championships Bear finished in the top 6 and Sky finished 3rd behind a Paralympic Gold Medalist and
					a European Champion.</p><br />

				<p>Both boys have got some points towards summer qualification so that’s a good start and am now looking forward to summer coming.</p><br />

					<p><span class="bold">Emma Stoner 12 years SL3 Player selected for Surrey U14 First Team</span></p><br>

					<p><span class="bold">Report by Lorraine Brydie Disability - Badminton coach at Wimbledon Racquets &amp; Fitness Club</span></p><br>
					<p>Emma joined our weekly disability badminton sessions, at the club, when she was just 8 yrs old. At that time she was a reluctant participant, but, with a little persuasion we soon turned this around and she has made great strides since!</p><br />

					<p>When Emma was just 10 yrs she competed in Surrey’s first senior Para-badminton tournament. Emma, at the time, knew that it was unlikely that she would win any games, but, this did not phase her in any way. I was so impressed by her attitude and the
						way she was able to focus and try to win every point she could. Last year she was runner up in the ladies doubles event!</p><br />

					<p>In the last 3 years Emma has been attending the monthly Talent Spotting disability badminton Sessions at the club. These are sponsored by The Anders Foundation and were set up to aid promising youngsters, aged 8 – 18 years, gain access to more intense
						coaching which would eventually steer them along the performance pathway. These sessions were set up to talent spot youngsters who have good hand-eye co-ordination but have a disability, physical or learning.</p><br />

					<p>In addition to these sessions, Emma joined the Raw Performance weekly junior sessions at the club. Playing alongside talented able-bodied players has been key to her most recent success. In the last year Emma has entered local Surrey junior events
						and has come runner up twice in the u14 girl’s singles tournament. Emma’s disability only requires her to play on a half court but she is competing and winning, against able-bodied players on a full court. This will stand her in good stead though
						as her classification may change. She is also playing doubles in these events which will give her invaluable experience in the future and will enhance her progress as an all-round event player.</p><br />

					<p>As a result of her success in Surrey, just recently she was invited to join the u14 squad for weekly training, and, soon after, was quickly selected to play for their second team. Her match results have been so astounding that she has now been selected
						for the first team!</p><br />

				<p>We are all very proud of Emma’s work ethic and sheer determination to give her very best each time she steps on the court. Her disability has never held her back. There is no doubt in my mind that she has all the vital components of a true champion
					and is part of the new wave of players coming through, who will go on to represent England in para badminton!!</p><br />

					<p>Lost for words..... A dream come true!!</p><br />

					<p>Today me and Sky became the Grade 1 National Champions with 71.49%.</p><br />

					<p>I cannot believe it. I have one very big smile on my face and cannot thank everyone enough who supports me as without you this wouldn't have been possible!</p><br />

					<p>Still not fully recovered and in a lot of pain! But completely worth it as I am now Grade 1 National Champion.</p><br />

					<p>But as we all know I couldn't have done it without Mr Sky. He tried his heart out and looked after me. He felt incredible and did an amazing test, nailing his halts! With two judges giving us over 72%. He is so special and I love him so much. He
						is my legs and together we excel!</p><br />

					<p>The run up to these champs was not one I would like to repeat. But we have done it and are Grade 1 National Champions. I couldn't be prouder of Sky. For me it’s also fantastic as I have given something back to everyone who has ever supported me and
						has believed in me.</p><br />

					<p>Hard work really does pay off. It really is a dream come true; still on cloud 9.</p><br />

					<p>After being selected for the World Games (for the 4th time) the day finally came to fly to Spain with Team GB. It was an amazing feeling being part of such a prestigious event and showing the world that after having a major Organ Transplant that

					<p>The Anders Foundation is helping Mari reach her goal of a place in her Grade 1 Dressage event for the Tokyo Olympics, 2020.</p><br>

					<p><span class="two_column_content_heading">Mari Writes:</span></p><br>

					<p>I am a Grade 1 (new grades for 2017) Para Dressage Rider; I have cerebral palsy that affects all four limbs and has left me weaker down my left side. As a result of my CP my coordination, balance and muscle tone are all affected. I compete in Para
						Dressage at National and International level.</p><br />

					<p>I am extremely grateful to have received a grant from the Anders Foundation. It will help enormously and allow me to have my trainer at all my competitions. It is important that I have my trainer at competitions as I am unable to work my horses in
						anything but walk; my trainer is able to warm them up properly for me and make sure that they are ready for me to go and produce the best result that we can in our tests.</p><br />

					<p>Horses are my legs and together we excel. I used to get bullied a lot when I was younger as I was different to other children but then I found riding and my life changed. This was something that I was extremely good at and able to succeed at.</p><br
					/>

					<p>I am told very often that I am an inspiration to others and I enjoy inspiring the next generation of para riders. My motto has always been ‘everything happens for a reason’. A lot has been thrown at me but I have dealt with it and will keep pushing
						and fighting until I reach my long term goal of getting to the Paralympics and winning a gold medal.</p><br />

					<p><span class="two_column_content_heading">Results from 2016</span></p><br />

					<p>I've just had a couple of Tournaments, the UK 4 Nations Championships and the International Irish Open.</p><br>

					<p>In the 4 Nations Championships I won Gold in the mixed doubles and came 3rd in the mens' doubles but had to pull out of the singles due to illness.</p><br>

					<p>At the Irish International I made it to the last 16 in mixed doubles just losing out to a pair from Japan. In both mens' singles and doubles I was drawn against the top seeds so wasn't able to progress further.</p><br>

					<h2>Visions inclusive badminton club</h2>
				</div>
				<div id="two_column_content">
					<p>Visions inclusive badminton club in Exmouth, Devon is run by former England Badminton player, Sue Louis Williams.</p><br>
					<p>The below is written by Sue:</p><br>

					<p>Our inclusive sessions are going really well; we are always full and have now designed our own awards for our players so that they have goals and targets to work towards.</p><br>

					<p>All our players are from local primary schools which I visit on a regular basis.The schools then nominate 2 players who are physically disabled and 2 players who have social difficulties. We offer them 4 free sessions..After that if they are enjoying
						the sessions they can join our inclusive club and pay £2 per visit. We have 2 children whom we fund because they are in care and also have 5 players who are now older (15 years) but still enjoy our sessions and cannot attend any other sports clubs
						outside the school environment because of their disabilities.</p><br>

					<p>We work closely with the local secondary school and I put all the badminton players through the young officials and young helpers awards; once they have done these awards we then use them at our sessions and pay then £5. It is always a struggle for
						us to make ends meet as we need a high ratio of coaches and helpers for each session.</p><br>

					<p>We have now purchased 4 junior sports wheel chairs. The boys chose green, red and blue frames and the girl a bright pink frame. These players then use the chairs, sometimes away from our club as I would rather they were in use than sitting in our
						cupboard during the week. We have enough specialist equipment but could always do financially with help towards coaches costs and court hire.</p><br>

					<p>David Follett of Devon Racqueteers Club takes the 4 players in wheel chairs and this is so motivating for the players and their parents to see what can be achieved with hard work. We then have myself and Sharon Hawkins who is the main coach at the
						Racqueteers in Exeter, along with England players, Alex and Ben Lane, and our young helpers.</p><br>

					<h2>Bedford &amp; District Handicapped Riders Assn.</h2>
				</div>
				<div id="two_column_content">

					<p>Bedford and District Handicapped Riders Association (BDHRA) was formed over 53 years ago and provides horse riding as therapy to disabled children and adults in Bedfordshire. Receiving no state funding they exist entirely from donations and charitable
						gifting.</p><br>

					<p>Over the course of a year approximately 113 children and adults enjoy the benefits of riding. It strengthens the core enabling children who may be confined to a wheelchair to sit for longer periods, it lengthens muscles which helps prevents spasms
						and also becomes a social life for people who find access to sport more difficult. Sometimes it takes three volunteers to help a rider – one to lead the horse and two to assist either side.</p><br>
					<p>Last year, the BDHRA received the Queens Award for Voluntary Services – the highest accolade for charitable causes.

					<p>Pupils from Blanche Nevile School, North London and Oak Lodge School for the Deaf, Balham, this week, took part in the above event.</p><br>

					<p>It was aimed at youngsters with a hearing impairment and/or with learning difficulties who had not represented their school before in badminton.</p><br>

					<p>The morning started with a fun warm up game. Fundamental skill stations were then set up for the pupils to move round in groups. This was followed by a fun game led by coaches Lorraine Brydie, Carol Bilton and Gary Sexton to finish off the mornings
						activities. After lunch the youngsters took part in a fun tournament which culminated in two finals. The A Singles final was particularly close where the players were given lots of positive encouragement from the side-lines.</p><br>

					<p>Trophies donated by Keith Henderson were awarded to:</p><br>

					<p>A Singles Winner – Brady Landu (Blanche Nevile) who beat Carolina Neves-Pinto (Blanche Nevile) 15-10. This was played on a full court.</p><br>

					<p>B Singles Winner – Isabella Ealey Newman (Oak Lodge) who beat Hamid Baig (Oak Lodge) 11-4. This was played on a ½ court.</p><br>

					<p><span class="two_column_content_heading">My Badminton year 2016 with the support of the Anders Foundation</span></p><br>
					<p>At the start of this Badminton year I decided to leave full time training at the National Badminton centre in Milton Keynes, after training for 2 years, and attend Bath University. As a junior I won the European under 17 Singles Gold medal and our
						National Under 11, 13, 15, and17 titles. I competed for England at the Youth Olympic Games in Australia and the World Junior Championships in Japan.</p><br>

					<p>When I left the National Badminton Centre all my funding was cut as I was no longer playing full time; however I still wanted to compete and train full time while studying for my degree with the plan of returning to full time play after university.
						The Anders Foundation has supported me this year and without their help I wouldn’t have been able to carry on playing the European circuit.</p><br>
					<p>This year has been my best year since leaving the junior circuit. At the start of the year I won my first senior International winning the Mens’ singles title at the Slovak Open. I then competed in the Welsh and Dutch Opens where I reached the quarter
						finals. I also played in the Scottish, Orleans, Polish and Hungary Internationals. </p><br>

				<p>I have really improved with these sessions. My fitness has gone up and I feel more agile and have more movement on the court. I feel better for it. My drop shot has improved and I am better able to get the shuttlecock to the back of the court when
					I'm standing sideways. I really appreciate the one to one coaching and feel very lucky.</p><br>

				<p>I finished 3rd in the WH1 singles and runner-up in the wheelchair mens doubles losing 19-21 -16-21.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately didn't get to contest the wheelchair mixed doubles as my partner had to withdraw due to injury and wasn't worth risking further damage with the World Championships just 2 weeks away.</p><br />
				<p>On the weekend of June 13th – 14th Owen competed in the English leg of the 4 Nations Para-Badminton series.</p><br />
				<p>Owen reached the semi-finals of the Wheelchair 1 mens singles losing out to top seed and world number 5 Connor Dua-Harper (Devon) 21-9 21-12.</p><br />

				<p>Playing with Denny Vettom (Aylesbury) in the mens doubles, Owen reached the final. Struggling to find any form or rhythm in the match, Owen again lost out to Dua-Harper and his Devon Racqueteers team mate David Follett 21 – 9 21 – 10.</p><br />

				<p>In the mixed doubles Owen paired up with Scotlands Fiona Christie. After being in top form In the group stage, defeating Dua-Harper and his partner Sharon Jones-Barnes in the group stage 21 – 15 21 – 12, the two pairs met again the final. The final
					was a much closer affair with the victors this time being Dua-Harper and Jones-Barnes with a 24-22 21-18 scoreline.</p><br />

				<p>Next up for Owen is the Irish Para-Badminton International Open in Dublin from June 24th -28th where he will try to gain as much world ranking points as possible to get a good ranking for the World Championships later on in the year to be hosted by

				<p><span class="bold">The Anders Foundation</span> recently helped Owen Kilburn purchase a new sports wheelchair.</p><br />
				<p>Owen is a 24 year old Nottingham Trent University Student and has played wheelchair Badminton for 9 years and is now a player who represents England in Para-Badminton.</p><br />
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Spanish ParaBadminton International, Alcudia, Spain - March 2015</span><br />
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Match Day 1</span>
				<p>I was placed into group D of the WH1 mens singles and I started the tournament off strong with a convincing 21 – 13, 21 – 7 win over Pascal Barrillon of France and I felt sharp and confident.</p><br />
				<p>The next match saw me up against the number 4 seed from Russia, Pavel Popov. I knew this would be a tough game for me but managed to stay in the game and never went behind up to 16 all where it was at this point I disappointingly conceded 5 straight
					points to lose the game 16 – 21. I went ahead 11 – 9 at the interval of the second game to then only get another 3 points for the remainder and lose 14 – 21.</p><br />
				<p>Despite losing I was able to advance past the group stage as runner-up of group D and into the last 16 where I faced India’s Prem Kule Ale. The first game was another close encounter up to the interval where again my opponent slipped away in the latter
					stages and they won 21 – 13. The second game was one of the most disappointing ones I had played all weekend. I turned up the intensity and found the form and sharpness I had from my very first match and had a commanding 18 – 12 lead and looked like
					I was sure to take the match to a 3rd game. Unfortunately my performance took a sudden drop and before I knew it I had lost the game 19 – 21. I was eliminated from the mens singles and I was gutted for letting a good opportunity slip away.</p><br
				/>
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Match Day 2</span>
				<p>The 2nd day was the start of the men’s doubles and was in group C seeded 3rd being teamed up with Ho Yuen Chan from Hong Kong.</p><br />
				<p>With the disappointment of the evening before still fresh in my mind the first doubles match was an extremely shakey performance, especially coming up against Prem Kumar Ale again with his Indian team mate Suresh Kumar Karki. I managed to get revenge
					on Prem for my Singles as we won 21-16, 21-19.</p><br />
				<p>Pascal Barrillon was then my opponent again teaming up with his French compatriot Sebastien Martin. My performance still wasn’t great but we took the first game 21-16. The second set I finally managed to regain my focus and relax and we won the second
					game with a comfortable score of 21-10.</p><br />
				<p>The final game of group C we came up against the Russian Pair of Pavel Popov and Yuri Stepanov. Here I had another opportunity to get revenge on a player I had lost to the day before. We were ahead 16-11 in the first game. However, I had a repeat
					of my match with Prem Kumar Ale, letting a good lead slip again and losing 18-21. A wave of thoughts were running through my head. The second game was very close for the majority and the Russians continued to isolate me keeping the shuttle away from
					my partner. Then something just ‘clicked’. I suddenly relaxed again and we took the second game 21-16 and then cruised to a 21-10 win in the final game.</p><br />
				<p>With all games won we topped group C and advanced to the quarter finals.</p><br />
				<p>The last match of the day we played another French pair; Stephen Durand and Francois Nalborczyk. This saw my best performance throughout the whole day and we cruised to a 21-10, 21-11 victory booking a place in the semi-final the next day.</p><br
				/>
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Match Day 3</span>
				<p>In the men’s doubles semi-final I played fellow England team mates and 2nd seeds Martin Rooke and Connor Dua-Harper who were heavy favourites. This match proved to be another level up and although I felt I played well, they were just too good and
					defeated us easily 2-21, 10-21.</p><br />
				<p>Overall despite there being a few disappointing performances I’m very happy to come away with my second medal in a BWF sanctioned International competition. I will learn and build from these experiences and aim to achieve more good results at the
					Irish International in June.</p><br />


				<p>Owen writes: "I have just competed in the 4 Nations Para-Badminton Championships in Scotland where, despite not being 100% fit, I managed to reach the semi final in the wheelchair mens singles losing to the eventual winner and England team mate Connor
					Dua-Harper 5 - 21, 15 - 21.</p><br />
				<p>In the mens doubles my partner withdrew from the tournament a couple days before due to illness, so unfortunately I didn't get to play mens doubles and we were certainly one of the favourites.</p><br />
				<p>In the mixed doubles I teamed up with Fiona Christie of Scotland for the first time. We reached the final and though I was disappointed with my own personal performance, feeling exhausted and still unwell from illness, we grinded out a win to take
					Gold in the mixed doubles winning in 3 games 18-21, 21 - 14, 21-19 against fellow English pair Denny Vettom and Sharon Jones-Barnes.</p><br />
				<p>The new chair has definitely helped my game a lot. It was just so unfortunate that I was ill and my fitness over the weekend was terrible because of it so I wasn't playing and using it to full capacity and intensity."</p><br />

				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Overview</span>
				<p>The Charity was formed over fifty years ago to use ponies as therapy to improve the co-ordination and health of handicapped children and adults. They maintain their own ponies and have their own purpose built indoor riding school in the village of

				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Fundraising</span>
				<p>Every year we need to raise approximately £20,000 just to keep things ticking over and we do this by organising fetes, craft fayres, coffee mornings and musical evenings but in these times of austerity it gets harder and harder to raise this amount.
					We also apply for funding from charitable institutions and family trusts.</p>

				<p>The Anders Foundation is delighted to support Sarah Underwood by donating the ex-racehorse mare Fleur De Vassy so that she can train for/compete in Para-Equestrian competitions and maybe one day reach the Paralympics.</p><br />

			<div id="two_column_content">
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Sarah's Story</span>
				<p>Complications during orthopaedic surgery several years ago resulted in over twenty five further surgeries and procedures, ongoing rehabilitation (which saved my lower leg from amputation) and my medical retirement from my job as a Senior Associate
					Clinical Psychologist within the NHS. Clearly this was life-changing, however always one to seek the positive and get on with things I began training with several Paralympic squads with a view to competing in the 2012 Paralympic games. Further surgery
					prevented this so I returned to my first love of horses and ponies and joined the Riding For The Disabled (RDA)! As well as being crucial to my rehabilitation I now have my sights firmly set upon attaining a place on the dressage team for the 2016
					Paralympic games in Rio!</p><br />

				<p>I recently represented Lancashire at the NW Regional competition and the North West at the RDA National Championships, borrowing horses at short notice for each event. Both were wonderful experiences and great fun. I have since joined the RDA volunteer
					database; have been elected to join the RDA Expert Panel; was invited to ride a para-dressage demonstration at Blenheim Palace Horse Trials and also at the NW Regional Conference, and have been invited to represent the RDA at the World Horse Welfare
					Annual Conference in London. All are fabulous opportunities and I am very honoured and privileged to have been invited to take part.</p><br />
				<p> I am also training to be both a BHS and RDA Instructor in the hope that I can utilise my experiences and skills to help others to enjoy the benefits that RDA has afforded me. The RDA magnificently enables people to enjoy equestrianism without huge
					expense, and thereby benefit from the pleasures and therapeutic gains associated with equine contact.</p><br />
				<p>Sadly I couldn’t ride at Blenheim due to the lack of a suitable horse but now, thanks to The Anders Foundation, I have a wonderful horse called Fleur De Vassy. Competing at the higher levels unfortunately requires sponsorship and a particular type
					of horse; as such I am so lucky to have Fleur so that I can achieve my dreams and one day ride for GB in the Paralympics. I am also proud that other disabled riders will be able to ride Fleur and enjoy some memorable days out in a non-competitive
					environment!</p><br />

				<p>Jamie Jessup from the Wimbledon Racquets & Fitness Club who was fortunate enough to have a Kidney Transplant 14 years ago - has just returned from Durban, South Africa where he represented GB in the World Transplant Games in July, 2013. Jamie brought
					home for Team GB the Badminton Singles Silver Medal in the 18-29 age category.</p><br />
				<p>Jamie says, "It was such a fantastic experience to go to Durban to represent my country in Badminton; I am passionate about the game and wanted to do well. I was in serious training for over a year, ever since being selected back in 2012 after my
					performance at the British Transplant Games where I won Gold in the mens’ doubles.</p><br />
				<p>In the lead up to the Worlds I was upping my game and having coaching from Sam Phillips & Dave Hutchinson. It certainly paid off when the day arrived for the competition in South Africa! In the singles I had a very tough draw and was up against players
					from France, GB, Iran, and in the final it was Iran again. In the semi's my energy had all been taken playing against the Iran player, but once I had beaten him I was thrilled knowing I had a chance of winning gold. The finals took place only 30
					mins after my semi's: I managed to win the first game, (I think it was purely on Adrenaline) but I lost the 2nd & 3rd.</p><br />
				<p>I can honestly say I am thrilled with a "World Silver Medal" & being ranked World Number 2 within the World Transplant Games Federation; this is something that will live with me forever! The second day of the Badminton I played mens’ doubles & mixed
					but, unfortunately, I couldn’t perform well as my legs were totally knackered, despite having an hour with our GB physio. It wasn't to be and we lost our doubles to the Thailand pair who were the eventual Gold Medallists.</p><br />
				<p>The same happened in the mixed which was in the afternoon. By this time my legs had totally seized up and we were knocked out by a Bulgarian pair.</p><br />
				<p>I am happy with my performance & can honestly say that being given that second chance in life has taught me something, and that is to enjoy every day as if it is my last & I certainly do do that. Especially in South Africa.</p><br />
				<p>I would like to say thank you so much to everyone at the Anders Foundation who has taken their time to help me along this wonderful journey and made a dream become reality, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart! </p><br />
				<p>But can I just ask one thing of you, please could you take a second or two, to sign up to the ORGAN DONATION REGISTER! As you too could help save someone's life, just like some one helped me!"</p><br />

				<span class="two_column_content_heading">Introduction</span>
				<p>Deborah Criddle MBE is a British para-equestrian who won three Gold Medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens and one Gold Medal and two Silver Medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.</p><br />
				<p>She lost the use of her right arm and right leg following a motorcycle accident in 1985, eventually having the arm amputated in 2003. As a result she competes in the Grade III Paralympic Classification.</p><br />
				<p>Deb first competed at the Paralympics at the 2000 Games held in Sydney, Australia, where she finished eighth in the Individual Grade III event and fourth in the Freestyle Grade III. She won Individual, Freestyle and Team Gold Medals at both the 2001
					European Championships and the 2003 World Championships. At the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece, she won three Gold Medals. Riding the Nina Venables owned horse Figaro IX she won the Individual and Freestyle Grade III events and was a part
					of Great Britain's victorious squad in the Team Championship. This made her and Figaro the first horse and rider combination to have won triple gold at consecutive European, World and Paralympic Games. At the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China,
					she was selected to compete as an individual rider and she finished fifth in the Individual and fourth in the Freestyle.</p><br />
				<p>She was selected as part of the dressage squad for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, United Kingdom. Riding LJT Akilles she won a silver medal in the Grade III Individual event with a score of 71.267%, finishing behind Germany's
					gold medalist Hannalore Brenner who scored 73.467%, despite having to ask the judges for directions. Criddle's result helped to secure a Gold Medal for the British squad, which also included Sophie Christiansen, Lee Pearson and Sophie Wells, in the
					Team Championship. She won her third medal of the 2012 Paralympics, a Silver, in the Freestyle Grade III. </p><br />
				<p>Criddle was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to equestrianism.</p>

				<p>Even winning the National Championship in my disability grade wasn’t enough to secure us a place on the European Championship squad this summer. We did however manage to qualify for a Disabled Rider class at the British Dressage National Championships
					along with a surprise qualification in an ‘able bodied’ open class. Equestrian is one of the few sports that is fully integrated, not only mixed gender but also disabled riders competing in the same classes as able bodied riders.</p><br />
				<p>The qualification classes for our Winter Championships are well underway with our first test giving us maximum points. </p><br />
				<p>I am hugely grateful to The Anders Foundation for awarding me a training grant which I intend to use to further improve my riding technique, which in turn will improve my communication with my horse. I will keep you posted...</p><br />

			<div id="two_column_content">
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">October 2013</span>
				<p>Back on track! LJT Akilles and I had a great result at the National Championships with a win in the KBIS Disabled Rider Championship and our best performance yet in a Para class. All the hard work at home paid dividends with a smooth and harmonious
					test on the day.</p><br />

				<p>We perform set floor plans for each disability grade and in very basic terms, for those with no knowledge of dressage, they are designed to test our ability to control the horse in various paces and our accuracy in carrying out particular movements.
					The tests take 5 minutes on average to perform and the horse needs warming up for anything between 30-60 minutes beforehand. Completing the second of our tests in the able-bodied Advanced Medium class was a highlight for me. We had absolutely no
					chance of coming anywhere other than near the bottom of the class just because of the quality of horses and the professional nature of many of the riders, but I had such fun. My goal had been not to be last and we managed to come 27th out of 32.
					It has definitely wetted my appetite for another chance so we shall have to get out now to try to qualify for the Winter Championships.</p><br />
			</div>

			<div id="two_column_content">
				<span class="two_column_content_heading">January 2014</span>
				<p>My New Year resolution is to be fitter this year and develop more core strength. I have made a start with short sessions on the cross-trainer which I will gradually build up in length as my unstable right knee becomes accustomed to the added stress
					and strain. Having said that, it seems to be the good one that is protesting more at the moment! I shall also book a place on a Pilates course or even arrange some private sessions so that I can specifically cover exercises best suited to riders.
					At Christmas I treated myself to a book called ‘Pilates for Riders’ and it has provided me with a real source of motivation. I have also now found three possible venues and trainers for my intensive lunge sessions but as they all teach outside I
					will wait for some better weather before booking.</p><br />

				<p>A few days before Christmas Akilles and I were out competing in Cornwall and whilst he was a bit fresh and feisty we had a good result with a win in the Advanced Medium Freestyle. This qualified us for a second class at the British Dressage SW Regional
					Winter Championship to be held in February, a good end to 2013.</p><br />

				<p>I sat down and made my 2014 Competition Plan; short, medium and long term goals are vital to a successful training regime and while the plan may need tweaking over the year it makes a good solid starting point. It means I can see where I need to have
					Akilles at peak fitness and where I can afford to ‘let him down’ a little as it is tough on a horse to push them hard throughout the season, dressage taxes the horse both physically and mentally. The overall long term goal is obviously Rio in 2016,
					the European Championships 2015 are the medium term goal with the short term one being the World Equestrian Games in France this summer. My goals for this year are to acquit myself well in open able-bodied classes, to be top Grade III Para rider
					in national competitions and make it on to the World Championship team. Hopefully I’m not being too greedy!</p><br />
